## Introduction

These Sushi Cards are going to help you learn to create computer programs in Scratch.

### What you will make

You will make a game where you try to protect people from malaria by catching mosquitos.

Here's an example of how the finished game might look:
    
<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/215534725/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Press the green flag to run the project above. Use the arrow keys to move the parrot around and try to catch the mosquitos.

### What you will learn

* Adding and deleting code blocks
* Basic motion:  move `n` steps and turn `n` degrees
* Using keyboard controls
* Using x/y coordinates to position sprites
* Changing the look of the stage and a sprite with costumes and show/hide
* Multiple sprites on screen
* Forever loops
* Detecting when sprites are touching
