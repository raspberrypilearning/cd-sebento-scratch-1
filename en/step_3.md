## Getting set up

Once you open Scratch, you’ll see a screen like the one below.

+ Look for each of the following parts and remember them.

 ### The Stage

title: What is the stage?
---
This is where your Scratch Programs run. It has

* One or more **backgrounds** \(images on the background of the screen\)

* Any **code blocks** associated with it \(we’ll get to this\)

 ### The Sprite List

Any object that goes on the stage is a sprite.  

In Scratch, the sprite is:
* The **image** on the stage
* Any alternative **costumes** \(looks\) it has
* Any **sounds** associated with it
* Any **code blocks** associated with it ![](images/setup2.png)

 ### The Code Blocks Pallete

---
title: Code blocks
---

Code in Scratch comes as blocks, that you click together to make programs. You choose blocks from the **code blocks palette** and drag them into the **current sprite panel**, then click them together.  
There are 10 categories of blocks, which are colour coded, and you can select each category from the list at the top of the **code blocks palette**.

 ### The Current Sprite panel

---

---

The **current sprite** is the one that's selected in the **sprite list**.

The **current sprite panel** is where you can see the code, costumes, and sounds for the selected sprite.

+ Time to get coding! Go back to Scratch and click on the Scratch Cat in the sprite list. The cat is now the current sprite.  
   
+ Go to the **Events** category in the **code blocks palette** and choose the `when [flag symbol] clicked`{:class="blockevents"} event, then drag it onto the **current sprite panel**.  

+ Then go to **Looks** in the **code blocks palette** and choose the `say [Hello!] for [2] secs`{:class="blocklooks"} block and drag it onto the **current sprite panel**, connecting it to the end of the other block, like this:

+ Now click the **Start Program** button and watch what happens!
